# Simple bevy game
I've been wanting to make a game for a long time. Now's the perfect time to do it and learn Rust in the process! I'm creating a simple game inspired by [jacques-dev](https://www.youtube.com/@jacques-dev) example. However, I've made some adjustments to make it work with Bevy version 0.13.2 and added some cool features not found in the original example.

#### Features (Not Included in the Original Example)
- You can shoot enemies.
- Enemies have random movement.

## In game
Your objective is to collect the stars and avoid the enemies. You can move using the WASD keys, shoot enemies with the left mouse button, and pause the game with the spacebar.
